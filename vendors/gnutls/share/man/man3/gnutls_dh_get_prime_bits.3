.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_dh_get_prime_bits(gnutls_session_t " session ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a gnutls session
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will return the bits of the prime used in the last
Diffie\-Hellman key exchange with the peer.  Should be used for both
anonymous and ephemeral Diffie\-Hellman.  Note that some ciphers,
like RSA and DSA without DHE, does not use a Diffie\-Hellman key
exchange, and then this function will return 0.
.SH "RETURNS"
The Diffie\-Hellman bit strength is returned, or 0 if no
Diffie\-Hellman key exchange was done, or a negative error code on
failure.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/extra.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_ia_allocate_client_credentials(gnutls_ia_client_credentials_t * " sc ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_ia_client_credentials_t * sc" 12
is a pointer to a \fBgnutls_ia_server_credentials_t\fP structure.

require an Application Phase after the TLS handshake (if the server
support TLS/IA).  Use \fBgnutls_ia_enable()\fP to toggle the TLS/IA mode.

On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned, otherwise
an error code is returned.

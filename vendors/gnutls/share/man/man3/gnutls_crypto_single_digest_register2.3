.SH NAME
gnutls_crypto_single_digest_register2 \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_crypto_single_digest_register2(gnutls_digest_algorithm_t " algorithm ", int " priority ", int " version ", const gnutls_crypto_digest_st * " s ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_digest_algorithm_t algorithm" 12
is the gnutls algorithm identifier
.IP "int priority" 12
is the priority of the algorithm
.IP "int version" 12
should be set to \fBGNUTLS_CRYPTO_API_VERSION\fP
.IP "const gnutls_crypto_digest_st * s" 12
is a structure holding new algorithms's data
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will register a digest (hash) algorithm to be used by
gnutls.  Any algorithm registered will override the included
algorithms and by convention kernel implemented algorithms have
priority of 90.  The algorithm with the lowest priority will be
used by gnutls.

This function should be called before \fBgnutls_global_init()\fP.

For simplicity you can use the convenience
\fBgnutls_crypto_single_digest_register()\fP macro.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP on success, otherwise an error.
.SH "SINCE"
2.6.0
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bug-gnutls@gnu.org>.

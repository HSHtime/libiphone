.SH NAME
gnutls_rehandshake \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_rehandshake(gnutls_session_t " session ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP structure.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will renegotiate security parameters with the
client.  This should only be called in case of a server.

This message informs the peer that we want to renegotiate
parameters (perform a handshake).

If this function succeeds (returns 0), you must call the
\fBgnutls_handshake()\fP function in order to negotiate the new
parameters.

Since TLS is full duplex some application data might have been
sent during peer's processing of this message. In that case
one should call \fBgnutls_record_recv()\fP until GNUTLS_E_REHANDSHAKE
is returned to clear any pending data. Care must be taken if
rehandshake is mandatory to terminate if it does not start after
some threshold.

If the client does not wish to renegotiate parameters he will
should with an alert message, thus the return code will be
\fBGNUTLS_E_WARNING_ALERT_RECEIVED\fP and the alert will be
\fBGNUTLS_A_NO_RENEGOTIATION\fP.  A client may also choose to ignore
this message.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP on success, otherwise an error.

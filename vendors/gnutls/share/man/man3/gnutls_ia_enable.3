.SH NAME
gnutls_ia_enable \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/extra.h>
.sp
.BI "void gnutls_ia_enable(gnutls_session_t " session ", int " allow_skip_on_resume ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP structure.
.IP "int allow_skip_on_resume" 12
non\-zero if local party allows to skip the
TLS/IA application phases for a resumed session.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Specify whether we must advertise support for the TLS/IA extension
during the handshake.

At the client side, we always advertise TLS/IA if gnutls_ia_enable
was called before the handshake; at the server side, we also
require that the client has advertised that it wants to run TLS/IA
before including the advertisement, as required by the protocol.

Similarly, at the client side we always advertise that we allow
TLS/IA to be skipped for resumed sessions if \fIallow_skip_on_resume\fP
is non\-zero; at the server side, we also require that the session
is indeed resumable and that the client has also advertised that it
allows TLS/IA to be skipped for resumed sessions.

After the TLS handshake, call \fBgnutls_ia_handshake_p()\fP to find out
whether both parties agreed to do a TLS/IA handshake, before
calling \fBgnutls_ia_handshake()\fP or one of the lower level gnutls_ia_*
functions.

.SH NAME
gnutls_priority_init \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_priority_init(gnutls_priority_t * " priority_cache ", const char * " priorities ", const char ** " err_pos ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_priority_t * priority_cache" 12
is a \fBgnutls_prioritity_t\fP structure.
.IP "const char * priorities" 12
is a string describing priorities
.IP "const char ** err_pos" 12
In case of an error this will have the position in the string the error occured
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Sets priorities for the ciphers, key exchange methods, MACs and
compression methods.  This provides a more flexible interface
compared to the gnutls_*_priority functions.

The \fIpriorities\fP parameter allows you to specify a colon separated
list of the cipher priorities to enable.

Unless the first keyword is "NONE" the defaults (in preference
order) are for TLS protocols TLS1.1, TLS1.0, SSL3.0; for
compression NULL; for certificate types X.509, OpenPGP.

For key exchange algorithms when in NORMAL or SECURE levels the
perfect forward secrecy algorithms take precedence of the other
protocols.  In all cases all the supported key exchange algorithms
are enabled (except for the RSA\-EXPORT which is only enabled in
EXPORT level).

Note that although one can select very long key sizes (such as 256
bits) for symmetric algorithms, to actually increase security the
public key algorithms have to use longer key sizes as well.

For all the current available algorithms and protocols use
"gnutls\-cli \-l" to get a listing.
.SH "COMMON KEYWORDS"
Some keywords are defined to provide quick access
to common preferences.

"PERFORMANCE" means all the "secure" ciphersuites are enabled,
limited to 128 bit ciphers and sorted by terms of speed
performance.

"NORMAL" means all "secure" ciphersuites.  The 256\-bit ciphers are
included as a fallback only.  The ciphers are sorted by security
margin.

"SECURE128" means all "secure" ciphersuites with ciphers up to 128
bits, sorted by security margin.

"SECURE256" means all "secure" ciphersuites including the 256 bit
ciphers, sorted by security margin.

"EXPORT" means all ciphersuites are enabled, including the
low\-security 40 bit ciphers.

"NONE" means nothing is enabled.  This disables even protocols and
compression methods.
.SH "SPECIAL KEYWORDS"
"!" or "\-" appended with an algorithm will remove this algorithm.

"+" appended with an algorithm will add this algorithm.

"%COMPAT" will enable compatibility features for a server.

"%DISABLE_SAFE_RENEGOTIATION" will disable safe renegotiation
completely.  Do not use unless you know what you are doing.
Testing purposes only.

"%UNSAFE_RENEGOTIATION" will allow handshakes and rehandshakes
without the safe renegotiation extension.  Note that for clients
this mode is insecure (you may be under attack), and for servers it
will allow insecure clients to connect (which could be fooled by an
attacker).  Do not use unless you know what you are doing and want
maximum compatibility.

"%PARTIAL_RENEGOTIATION" will allow initial handshakes to proceed,
but not rehandshakes.  This leaves the client vulnerable to attack,
and servers will be compatible with non\-upgraded clients for
initial handshakes.  This is currently the default for clients and
servers, for compatibility reasons.

"%SAFE_RENEGOTIATION" will enforce safe renegotiation.  Clients and
servers will refuse to talk to an insecure peer.  Currently this
causes operability problems, but is required for full protection.

"%SSL3_RECORD_VERSION" will use SSL3.0 record version in client
hello.

"%VERIFY_ALLOW_SIGN_RSA_MD5" will allow RSA\-MD5 signatures in
certificate chains.

"%VERIFY_ALLOW_X509_V1_CA_CRT" will allow V1 CAs in chains.
.SH "NAMESPACE"
To avoid collisions in order to specify a compression algorithm in
this string you have to prefix it with "COMP\-", protocol versions
with "VERS\-", signature algorithms with "SIGN\-" and certificate
types with "CTYPE\-".  Other algorithms don't need a prefix.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
"NORMAL:!AES\-128\-CBC" means normal ciphers except for AES\-128.

"EXPORT:!VERS\-TLS1.0:+COMP\-DEFLATE" means that export ciphers are
enabled, TLS 1.0 is disabled, and libz compression enabled.

"NONE:+VERS\-TLS1.0:+AES\-128\-CBC:+RSA:+SHA1:+COMP\-NULL", "NORMAL",
"%COMPAT".
.SH "RETURNS"
On syntax error \fBGNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST\fP is returned,
\fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP on success, or an error code.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"

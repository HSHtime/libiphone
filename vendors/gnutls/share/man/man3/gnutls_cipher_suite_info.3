.SH NAME
gnutls_cipher_suite_info \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "const char * gnutls_cipher_suite_info(size_t " idx ", char * " cs_id ", gnutls_kx_algorithm_t * " kx ", gnutls_cipher_algorithm_t * " cipher ", gnutls_mac_algorithm_t * " mac ", gnutls_protocol_t * " min_version ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "size_t idx" 12
index of cipher suite to get information about, starts on 0.
.IP "char * cs_id" 12
output buffer with room for 2 bytes, indicating cipher suite value
.IP "gnutls_kx_algorithm_t * kx" 12
output variable indicating key exchange algorithm, or \fBNULL\fP.
.IP "gnutls_cipher_algorithm_t * cipher" 12
output variable indicating cipher, or \fBNULL\fP.
.IP "gnutls_mac_algorithm_t * mac" 12
output variable indicating MAC algorithm, or \fBNULL\fP.
.IP "gnutls_protocol_t * min_version" 12
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Get information about supported cipher suites.  Use the function
iteratively to get information about all supported cipher suites.
Call with idx=0 to get information about first cipher suite, then
idx=1 and so on until the function returns NULL.
.SH "RETURNS"
the name of \fIidx\fP cipher suite, and set the information
about the cipher suite in the output variables.  If \fIidx\fP is out of
bounds, \fBNULL\fP is returned.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bug-gnutls@gnu.org>.

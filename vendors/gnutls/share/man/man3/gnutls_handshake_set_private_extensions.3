.SH NAME
gnutls_handshake_set_private_extensions \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "void gnutls_handshake_set_private_extensions(gnutls_session_t " session ", int " allow ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP structure.
.IP "int allow" 12
is an integer (0 or 1)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will enable or disable the use of private cipher
suites (the ones that start with 0xFF).  By default or if \fIallow\fP
is 0 then these cipher suites will not be advertized nor used.

Unless this function is called with the option to allow (1), then
no compression algorithms, like LZO.  That is because these
algorithms are not yet defined in any RFC or even internet draft.

Enabling the private ciphersuites when talking to other than
gnutls servers and clients may cause interoperability problems.

.SH NAME
gnutls_x509_crt_get_fingerprint \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_crt_get_fingerprint(gnutls_x509_crt_t " cert ", gnutls_digest_algorithm_t " algo ", void * " buf ", size_t * " sizeof_buf ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t cert" 12
should contain a \fBgnutls_x509_crt_t\fP structure
.IP "gnutls_digest_algorithm_t algo" 12
is a digest algorithm
.IP "void * buf" 12
a pointer to a structure to hold the fingerprint (may be null)
.IP "size_t * sizeof_buf" 12
initially holds the size of \fIbuf\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will calculate and copy the certificate's fingerprint
in the provided buffer.

If the buffer is null then only the size will be filled.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBGNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER\fP if the provided buffer is
not long enough, and in that case the *sizeof_buf will be updated
with the required size.  On success 0 is returned.

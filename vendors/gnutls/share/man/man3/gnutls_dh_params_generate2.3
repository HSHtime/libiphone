.SH NAME
gnutls_dh_params_generate2 \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_dh_params_generate2(gnutls_dh_params_t " params ", unsigned int " bits ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_dh_params_t params" 12
Is the structure that the DH parameters will be stored
.IP "unsigned int bits" 12
is the prime's number of bits
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will generate a new pair of prime and generator for use in
the Diffie\-Hellman key exchange. The new parameters will be allocated using
\fBgnutls_malloc()\fP and will be stored in the appropriate datum.
This function is normally slow.

Note that the bits value should be one of 768, 1024, 2048, 3072 or 4096.
Also note that the DH parameters are only useful to servers.
Since clients use the parameters sent by the server, it's of
no use to call this in client side.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (zero) is returned,
otherwise an error code is returned.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"

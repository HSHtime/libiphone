.SH NAME
gnutls_session_get_data2 \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_session_get_data2(gnutls_session_t " session ", gnutls_datum_t * " data ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP structure.
.IP "gnutls_datum_t * data" 12
is a pointer to a datum that will hold the session.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns all session parameters, in order to support resuming.  The
client should call this, and keep the returned session, if he wants
to resume that current version later by calling
\fBgnutls_session_set_data()\fP.  This function must be called after a
successful handshake.  The returned datum must be freed with
\fBgnutls_free()\fP.

Resuming sessions is really useful and speedups connections after
a successful one.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned, otherwise
an error code is returned.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bug-gnutls@gnu.org>.

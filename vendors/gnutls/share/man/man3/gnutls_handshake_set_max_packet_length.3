.SH NAME
gnutls_handshake_set_max_packet_length \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "void gnutls_handshake_set_max_packet_length(gnutls_session_t " session ", size_t " max ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP structure.
.IP "size_t max" 12
is the maximum number.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will set the maximum size of all handshake messages.
Handshakes over this size are rejected with
\fBGNUTLS_E_HANDSHAKE_TOO_LARGE\fP error code.  The default value is
48kb which is typically large enough.  Set this to 0 if you do not
want to set an upper limit.

The reason for restricting the handshake message sizes are to
limit Denial of Service attacks.
